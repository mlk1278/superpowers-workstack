# WorkStack PR Monitor

Own exactly one PR and its worktree until it is merged or genuinely blocked. This skill is the sole source of WorkStack PR review, CI, fix-loop, and merge mechanics; callers start it once and wait for its return.

## Project policy

Read `.workstack/pr-policy.md` at the repository root when it exists. It names the review providers to await, how to request them, complexity lanes, and timeout policy. Without it, the required conditions are exact-head green CI, zero unresolved review threads, and no requested-changes review. Never hard-code a provider this file does not name.

## Preflight

Capture the PR number, branch, current full head SHA, merge state, and the approved local-gate SHA. The local final gate must have approved this exact head before monitoring begins. Bind all evidence to the current head; any push starts a new evidence cycle. Exception: a push whose commits touch only Markdown files under `docs/**` or at the repository root, or `.superpowers/**` scratch, carries local-gate and completed-review evidence forward — record it explicitly ("gate at `<sha>`; head advanced by docs-only `<sha>..<sha>`"). A file the application builds, renders, or serves, or that CI executes, never qualifies regardless of path. CI is never carried forward: exact-head green CI is still required on the new head. For provider completion, a review object naming the recorded carried-forward predecessor head counts as current-head completion — do not request a new provider review for a docs-only push.

## Monitor loop

1. Refresh the PR head, merge state, and unresolved threads. A conflicting PR schedules no CI; resolve the conflict before diagnosing missing checks.
2. Refresh exact-head CI (`gh pr checks` or the policy file's command). Distinguish failed from pending from unavailable, and fail closed on unavailable — it is not a green result.
3. Await, and at most once per head request each policy-named provider. Only a current-head review object or an authenticated completion naming the current commit counts as completion; acknowledgements and reactions never do.
4. Verify findings against the code. Send valid findings as one batch to a fresh implementer routed via workstack-agent-routing, confirm the fixer's fresh passing covering-test evidence and inspect the fixes (never rerun a local workspace suite — exact-head CI owns suite-level regression), push once, then resume the local gate reviewer thread on the delta. Concretely rebut invalid findings on the PR.
5. Rerun the full local review gate (a review, not a workspace test suite) instead of a delta review when a fix materially changes behavior, architecture, migration, or risk.
6. If no action is ready, wait one bounded interval (default 180 seconds; policy may override) and refresh. Do not nest another watcher.

## Fallback

After the policy timeout on one head (default 60 minutes), or on explicit provider failure or rate limiting, exact-head green CI plus the recorded local gate approval is sufficient. Record the fallback reason. Do not switch to a provider the policy does not name.

## Merge and return

Immediately before merging, re-verify on the expected head (or a head that differs from it only by recorded docs-only carry-forward commits): policy-named providers or the recorded fallback, exact-head green CI, mergeability, and zero unresolved threads. Merge when all pass, confirm the remote PR is `MERGED`, and return the exact merge state — PR number, merged SHA, and merge commit — to the caller. The caller owns post-merge reconciliation.
