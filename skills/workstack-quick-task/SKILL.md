# WorkStack Quick Task

**Announce:** "I'm using workstack-quick-task to ship this."

**Entry:** a small, decision-complete request — the ask itself is the spec.
**Exit:** the shared delivery path returns merged and cleaned up, or the request is redirected to upstream planning.

## 1. Scope check

Confirm the work has one coherent outcome, an established owner surface, no unresolved product decision, and no need for multiple PRs. Explore only enough to name the owning files and binding repository rules. If any condition fails, use upstream `brainstorming` and `writing-plans`. A quick task may reference an existing Linear ticket but never creates one to mirror a tiny local change.

## 2. Mini-plan

Write an ignored one-task implementation plan at `.superpowers/quick/<slug>-plan.md` in upstream writing-plans format. Include the request, exact files, TDD steps, and verification commands. The mini-plan is scratch and is never committed.

## 3. Deliver

Invoke `workstack-delivery` with the mini-plan path, using its absolute path so it remains available after entering the delivery worktree. Delivery owns the worktree, routing, SDD, optional UX gate, PR, merge, and cleanup.
